# AI Agent Guidelines

This directory contains guidelines and workflows for AI agents working on this project.

## 📋 Contents

### **CLEAN_CODE_GUIDE.md**
Comprehensive clean code guidelines that AI agents must follow when working on this project. 

**Key Points:**
- AI agents must prioritize clean code principles
- AI agents must request user consent before deviating from clean code standards
- Includes specific thresholds (e.g., file length, function complexity) that trigger consent requests
- Provides templates for requesting consent

### **workflows/** (directory)
Contains reusable workflow definitions for common tasks in this project.

## 🎯 Purpose

These guidelines ensure that:
1. Code quality remains high across all AI-assisted contributions
2. Technical debt is minimized and tracked
3. Users maintain control over code quality trade-offs
4. AI agents follow established project patterns and conventions

## 🚀 For AI Agents

If you're an AI agent working on this project:

1. **Read** `CLEAN_CODE_GUIDE.md` before making any code changes
2. **Follow** the clean code principles outlined in the guide
3. **Request consent** when you need to deviate from clean code standards
4. **Use** the provided consent request template for clarity
5. **Check** the workflows directory for established procedures

## 🔄 Maintenance

This directory should be updated as:
- New patterns emerge in the project
- Team standards evolve
- New workflows are established
- Best practices are refined
