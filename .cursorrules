# Cursor Rules for VolleyFlow

## Git Operations
- **DO NOT** make git commits automatically
- **DO NOT** make git push automatically
- Only perform git operations when explicitly requested by the user
- When making changes, inform the user that they need to commit manually

## Code Style
- Follow Flutter/Dart best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Localization
- All user-facing strings must be localized using AppLocalizations
- Check existing ARB files before adding new translation keys
